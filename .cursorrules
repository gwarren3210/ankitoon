# AnkiToon Project Rules

## Code Style

Be concise in detriment to grammar but without losing clarity

Use absolute paths when importing or referencing other files

Don't use emojis

## Naming Conventions

### Folders
Use **kebab-case** (e.g., `user-profile`, `api-services`).

### Files
- **Code files:** Use **camelCase** (e.g., `loginForm.ts`, `userData.js`)
- **Markdown files:** Use **kebab-case** (e.g., `rebuild-documentation.md`, `api-documentation.md`)
- **Config files:** Follow conventional naming (e.g., `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json`)

### Extensions
Use extensions as appropriate for the project (e.g., `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.md`, etc.)

## Separation of Concerns

Each file should handle a **single responsibility**:
- **Components**: Only presentational logic
- **Hooks**: Only reusable logic
- **Services**: Only data/API handling

Avoid mixing unrelated logic (e.g., API calls and UI rendering in the same file)

## File Size & Complexity

Keep files **small and modular**:
- Aim for **~200-300 lines max**
- Lines should not exceed 80 characters
- If a file exceeds this, split it into smaller files

## Config & Environment Files

All configuration and environment files (`.env`, `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, etc.) should live in the **project root**

Common ignore rules:
- `.DS_Store`
- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`, `build/`, or other build output folders
- `.log` files

## Folder Creation by Agents

Agents should only create folders based on the directory outline specified in the PRD (Product Requirements Document)

No additional folders should be added unless explicitly mentioned in the PRD

## Function Documentation

Any function longer than **3 lines** if it is not trivial must include:
- A **short description** of what it does
- The **input types** and **output types** (in code comments or JSDoc-style comments)

## File Structure & Main Function

The **main file function** should be placed at the **top of the file**

The **main file function** should **not include any logic**; it should only **assemble** and **orchestrate** the **helper functions** defined **below** it

Example:
```python
def main():
  out1 = helper1()
  out2 = helper2()
  out3 = helper3(out1, out2)
  return out3

def helper1():
  return 'a'

def helper2():
  return 'b'

def helper3(a, b):
  return a + b
```

## Git Rules

New features should be made on a new branch (named clearly)

Never push directly to `main`; all changes must go through a pull request (PR)

## Rules Updates

Rules can be **created or updated** by either the **user** or the **AI agent**

Any new or updated rules must be **clearly described** and added in the same format as existing rules
