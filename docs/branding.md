## Future Considerations

As Toonky grows and adds features (streaks, achievements, community), maintain these core principles:

- **Data-driven recommendations** should feel helpful, not algorithmic
- **Community features** should enhance learning, not distract from it
- **Achievements** should mark real progress, not arbitrary actions
- **Streaks** should encourage consistency without inducing guilt

Remember: Every feature must answer "Does this help users read webtoons in Korean?"
